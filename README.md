**Challenge:** Saptang Labs – Machine Learning Challenge  
**Author:** Turing Machines  
**Date:** October 2025

## 1.  Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the design and architecture of an **Agentic Reasoning System (ARS)** — an AI system capable of autonomously decomposing, planning, executing, and verifying solutions for logic-based reasoning tasks.
Unlike monolithic large language models, ARS performs **structured multi-step reasoning** by integrating lightweight models, symbolic tools, and rule-based planning.

### 1.2 Scope

The system aims to:

* Decompose complex logic problems into solvable subproblems.
* Dynamically select the most appropriate solver or tool.
* Execute subtasks sequentially or in parallel.
* Verify intermediate and final results.
* Produce transparent, human-readable reasoning traces.

The final deliverable is a modular, interpretable pipeline optimized for **accuracy, transparency, and reproducibility**.

## 5.  Module Descriptions

### 5.1 Problem Decomposer

**Goal:** Convert a raw natural language problem into atomic subproblems.
**Techniques:**

* we are using T5-small and training it on GSM8K and is available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/grade-school-math/refs/heads/master/grade_school_math/data/train.jsonl

**Output Example:**

```json
{"question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?",
"answer": "Natalia sold 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips in May.\nNatalia sold 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 clips altogether in April and May.\n#### 72"}
```

---

### 5.2 Planner & Tool Mapper

**Goal:** Assign each subproblem to the most efficient solving mechanism and we will be using T5-small on the dataset and is available at https://math-qa.github.io/

| Subproblem Type | Tool/Method                   | Example                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Arithmetic      | Internal calculator           | `200 / (60+40)`               |
| Algebraic       | SymPy symbolic solver         | Solve for x in `2x + 3 = 7`   |
| Logical         | Rule-based inference / Prolog | Deduce from premises          |
| Algorithmic     | Python code executor          | Simulation or iteration tasks |

**Output Example:**

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"step": "relative_speed", "tool": "calculator"},
    {"step": "meeting_time", "tool": "symbolic_solver"}
  ]
}
```

---

### 5.3 Executor & Verifier

**Goal:** Execute subtasks, verify results, and check intermediate consistency and we will be using the following datset for it https://huggingface.co/datasets/D3xter1922/proofwriter-dataset

**Verification Strategies:**

* **Redundant evaluation:** Use both numeric and symbolic solvers.
* **Tolerance-based check:** `abs(result_1 - result_2) < ε`.
* **Dimensional analysis:** Ensure unit consistency.
* **Logic equivalence:** Validate logical expressions via Z3 or truth tables.

**Output Example:**

```json
{
  "execution_results": {
    "relative_speed": "100 km/h",
    "meeting_time": "2 hours"
  },
  "verification": "passed"
}
```

## 8.  Example Walkthrough

**Input:**

> "A box contains 5 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls. If one ball is drawn at random, what is the probability it is not green?"

**Pipeline Trace:**

1. **Decompose:**

   * Identify total balls = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10.
   * Identify favorable = not green → 8.
   * Apply probability formula P = favorable / total.
2. **Select Tools:**

   * Use symbolic/numeric calculator.
3. **Execute:**

   * P = 8 / 10 = 0.8.
4. **Verify:**

   * Alternate check via complementary probability: 1 – (2/10) = 0.8 → matches.
